##Correlations falls between -1 and 1. 0 suggests there is no association between the two variables while numbers close to -1 or 1 suggests a strong negative and positive associations accordingly.

##This also shows that wine quality has positive correlation with alcohol and negative correlation with chlorides and density

##Random Forest Model
##Random forests improve predictive accuracy by generating a large number of bootstrapped trees (based on random samples of variables), classifying a case using each tree in this new "forest", and deciding a final predicted outcome by combining the results across all of the trees (an average in regression, a majority vote in classification). Breiman and Cutler's random forest approach is implimented via the randomForest package.

library(randomForest)

model2 = randomForest(rating ~ . -X -quality, data = white)

pred2 = predict(model2)

print(model2) 
importance(model2)        ##used to find importance of each predictor

## Significant increase in accuracy with use of this model
